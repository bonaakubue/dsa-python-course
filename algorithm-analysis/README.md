# Algorithm Analysis

## Description
The **Algorithm Analysis** module provides a foundation for understanding the efficiency and performance of algorithms. It covers fundamental concepts such as time complexity, space complexity, asymptotic notation, and empirical analysis of algorithms.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
- Algorithm Efficiency
- Asymptotic Notation (Big-O, Theta, Omega)
- Best, Worst, and Average Case Analysis

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with mathematical functions and notation
- Logical reasoning skills

## Installation
